# Assignment 1: Data Analytics

## Overview

This assignment is a test of your **algorithmic thinking**. You can use any **A.I. tools** to assist you in this coding assignment.

## Instructions

1. **Work in Pairs** – Preferably with your thesis partner.
2. **Create a GitHub Repository** titled **'Assignment\_1\_Data\_Analytics'**.
3. **Read the Provided Journal** – Understand the concepts and methodologies discussed.
4. **Develop a Python Implementation** – Implement the procedures described in the journal.
5. **Submit Before Premidterm Week** – Ensure timely completion and submission.

## Implementation Details

This repository contains a Python-based implementation of **Balanced Risk Set Matching (BRSM)** for analyzing treatment effects in observational studies. The methodology involves:

- Simulating synthetic patient data.
- Applying Mahalanobis distance for patient matching.
- Conducting statistical tests to evaluate treatment effects.
- Visualizing symptom distributions pre- and post-treatment.

## Features

- **Pre-treatment and post-treatment outcome simulation**.
- **Mahalanobis distance-based patient matching**.
- **Comparative statistical analysis** using Wilcoxon Signed-Rank and Mann-Whitney U tests.
- **Data visualization** to demonstrate treatment effects.
